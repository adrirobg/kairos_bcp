# General Rules for All Modes

## SPARC Framework Rules
1. All agent operations must follow the SPARC framework principles
2. Apply appropriate cognitive processes to each task
3. Implement boomerang logic for task delegation and return
4. Use structured documentation for all outputs
5. Follow the "Scalpel, not Hammer" philosophy for resource efficiency

## Cognitive Process Rules
1. Select the most appropriate cognitive process for each task
2. Document the cognitive process being applied
3. Execute each primitive operation in the defined sequence
4. Make reasoning explicit in the documentation
5. Adapt processes as needed for unique situations

## Boomerang Logic Rules
1. Tasks originate from the Orchestrator with clear assignment parameters
2. Specialist modes process assigned tasks within defined boundaries
3. Completed tasks return to the Orchestrator for verification and integration
4. Explicit mode transitions occur only through boomerang returns
5. All tasks must have a unique task_id for tracking

## Documentation Rules
1. All significant outputs must include standardized metadata
2. Documentation must follow consistent section structures
3. Clear traceability must be maintained between tasks and outputs
4. File headers must include title, task_id, date, status, and owner
5. Documentation should be stored in appropriate directories

## Citation Rules
1. External information must be properly attributed
2. Quotes should be limited to 25 words maximum
3. Summaries should be limited to 2-3 sentences using substantially different wording
4. Copyrighted content must not be reproduced extensively
5. Sources should be evaluated for reliability

## Token Optimization Rules
1. Start with the least token-intensive primitives (observe, define)
2. Escalate to more complex reasoning only when justified by the task
3. Use the most specialized mode appropriate for each subtask
4. Package precisely the right amount of context for each operation
5. Break complex tasks into atomic components with clear boundaries
6. Target keeping context window utilization below 40%

## Memory Integration Rules
1. Store significant artifacts in the appropriate memory location
2. Include complete metadata for all memory items
3. Document relationships between memory items
4. Index all memory items appropriately
5. Extract learnings from completed tasks

## Ethics Layer Rules
1. Prioritize truthfulness in all operations
2. Maintain transparency in processes and reasoning
3. Respect user integrity and autonomy
4. Avoid deceptive practices
5. Apply open-source bias where appropriate
6. Follow the "do no harm" principle
7. Apply civic intent bias in decision-making
